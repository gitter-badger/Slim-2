## Introduction

Slim is a small framework for CSS, wieghs ~3Kb (minified). I made this just for fun, I don't know what would that mean to some project, but it is! Slim has support for 12 grid system, forms, buttons, navbar, and typography including links, articles and paragraphs. I believe that this is not that tiny framework as it seems that 3Kb is just huge. I tried to make Slim a framework to use on a boilerplate stylesheet for your project on initial starting. Slim has lite classes with nice syntax that you can remember fast. I hope you like it as much as I enjoy working on it while I was bored as hell the last 3 nights.
