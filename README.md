## Introduction

*Slim* is a small framework for CSS, wieghs **~3Kb** *(minified)*. I made this just for fun, I don't know what would that mean to some project, but it is! *Slim* has support for *12 grid system that is based on Flexbox, forms, buttons, navbar, and typography including links, articles and paragraphs*.
I know! 3Kb is just *huge*, but...
*Slim* could behave as a nice boilerplate stylesheet for your initial project. Slim has lite classes with nice syntax that you can remember fast. And I hope you like it as much as I enjoyed working on it while I was bored as hell the last 3 nights.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save slim
